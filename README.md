# Customer Churn Prediction

This is a Artificial Neural Network based Deep Learning model which predicts whether the person will churn or not based on various factors given in the dataset.

## Process

1.Importing necessary libraries

2.Reading Dataset

3.Handling Null values

3.Data Visualization

4.Label Encoding

5.Scalling

6.Splitting the dataset into traning and testing

7.Model Building

8.Evaluation and performance

## About Neural Network 

- Artificial Neural Network
- Input layer with 26 neurons
- Hidden Layer with 20 neurons
- Output layer with 1 neuron for binary Classification
- Activation Function Used { Sigmoid , reLu }

## Use cases

Customer Churn Prediction hepls companies to figure out why customers are leaving from thier company and by this Deep learning model they can figure out on what factors they are lacking.
